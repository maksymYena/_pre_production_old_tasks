This repository exists for nostalgic purposes. 

These tasks and this code were written during the author's development as a developer / Automator. 

The repository includes java tasks and test automation tasks.

You can see the result of my education from zero (another description for 'scratch' knowledge) to Junior SW Test Automation Engineer.

Thank u for your time â™¥
